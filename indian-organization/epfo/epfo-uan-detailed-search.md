# EPFO UAN Detailed Search

### &#xD;Introduction

UAN stands for **Universal Account Number**. EPFO allots a **12 Digit UAN** for every individual who becomes a member of EPFO. _The UAN remains the same throughout life_, although the Member ID/EPF Account numbers change whenever the employee changes jobs.&#x20;

### API Usecase

The EPFO UAN Basic Search API uses the employee UAN number to retrieve all the organisational details as well as the employeeâ€™s account details.

Similar to the Basic Search API, the EPFO UAN Detailed Search service returns a more detailed report on the particulars of the employee account like bank account number, IFSC code etc. As the name suggests, the objective of this API is to provide a more detailed report of the organisation employee. The API accepts the UAN and password of the employee portal as input to generate the details.

**The following information is generated:**

* Name&#x20;
* Mobile Number
* Email ID
* Bank account number
* IFSC Code
* Aadhaar number
* UAN Number
* PF account number
* Establishment Name
* Establishment Address
* Date of joining
* PF account holder
* Member's Name
* Date of birth
* Father's spouse name
* Relationship
* Establishment split address



### How to call the API
