# API Error Codes

Whenever a user encounters an error in the API, certain system messages might be displayed with a unique identifier in number format, known as an error code. These codes denote the status or reason for the error.&#x20;

Our API returns standard HTTP success or error status codes. For errors, we also include extra information about what went wrong encoded in the response as JSON. The various HTTP status codes we might return are listed below.

| _CODE_  | _TITLE_                    | _DESCRIPTION_                                                                                                                                                                                        |
