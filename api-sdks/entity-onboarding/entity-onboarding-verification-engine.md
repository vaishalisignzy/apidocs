# Entity Onboarding Verification Engine

As world goes digital there is greater need to onboard people remotely. Or to increase efficiency of the sales person on the ground. Thus there needs to be a solution that takes current practices, uses Data APIs and AI technology to convert the process into a remote process.

Verification Engines have flows that are unique to each use cases - Merchant Onboarding, Current Account Opening, Trade DD etc. The complete merchant application with several input parameters is is taken as in input JSON, the engine after making verifications and intelligent checks returns back a report on the merchant in an output JSON form.

#### Integration Flow

**Logging in**

You would have understood logging in by now if you would have used our other APIs. In case you are only integrating Individual Onboarding Verification Engine you can understand logging in from [Authentication ](https://docs-staging.signzy.tech/)section

**Sending a request**

Both Input request and Output JSON have lot of fields and parameters, which can be confusing. The way this has been structured is in blocks. If you are integrating only one or two of the functionality you can only focus on your block and comment out or delete other blocks.

We have put the complete request and response JSON, in two separate sections - Input Verification data and Get data. You can use them.

But let us first explain the different blocks and how they can help you achieve your goal of faster digital onboarding for customer

**Basic Information Block**

This block contains basic information of the entity that you might have gathered through forms or earlier customer interaction such as name, email etc. This data is useful when you are using Signzyâ€™s backops workflow system ( To know more about our workflow product contact your sales executive ).

**JSON Request**

```

"info": {
		"name ": "",
		"permanentAddress": "",
		"emailId": "",
		"phone": "",
		"dob": "",
		"communicationAddress": ""
	}
```

**JSON Response**

```
"info": {
        "name": "..name..",
        "emailId": "..emailId..",
        "phone": "..phone..",
        "permanentAddress": "",
        "dob": "",
        "communicationAddress": ""
    },
```

**IDcard Block**

This block is used to verify ID data against Govt/Agency APIs and also gives back a forgery score for the ID images (if they are passed).

ID Data Verification- The demographic data is verified against the ID from a govt or agency at the background.

Forgery - The goal is to be able to verify that the ID image is of a genuine ID card. This prevents random images, forged IDs or bad quality images.

This block basically needs to pass ID data, ID Image and whether its just for Proof of Identity (PoI) or Proof of Address (PoA). In case of PoA, the address also gets verified. In case you are not sure just pass both(POA/POI) in the purpose parameter.

**JSON Request**

```
"idCards": [{
					"type": "aadhaar/passport/dl/pan/voterid",
					"images": [],
					"idNo": "",
					"name": "",
					"dob": "",
					"address": "",
					"gender": "",
					"age": "",
					"nationality": "",
					"issueDate": "",
					"state": "",
					"purpose": ["POI", "POA"],
					"verify": "true / false"
				},
			],
```

In response if both ID data check and forgery have been requested then you will get multiple pieces of data

1. You wil get back the results from data check and if the demographics such as Name, DoB, Address matched against the ID.
2. You will get a detailed response back on Forgery. This has two parts.
   * Text Match Score - The variable inputmatcher , gives you data which tells you if the data submitted by the user as his demographic matches with the data on the ID card
   * Digi Eyes Score - This is a comprehensive score on the ID and replicates human like intelligence making use of logos, position of text, face image and colors to judge if the ID is genuinely as claimed
3. You also get an additional response on Image Forensics if that is enabled in your package. It has two types
   * Image meta-data - This data is interesting as it helps you find out if the user had used some software or mobile as its last modification. While this may not guarantee that the image has been manipulated but might along with other data act as a powerful indicator for fraud
   * Image Manipulation - This gives an image as output. The image is based on an algorithm which finds aberration whenever there is photoshop or image changes of any kind. You can talk to our expert to understand this better, if you really want to see how this works.

**Bank Account Verification Block**

This block is used to verify a bank account data. There are 3 goals

1. to verify if the Bank Account is Active
2. If the account belongs to an entity by same name
3. To verify if the current end-user actually has control over the account. This allows you to not only make sure you are onboarding a user with genuine bank account but also is a double proof that its not owned by someone else.

**Note :**

This feature is currently only available in India.

**Video Verification Block**

Video Verification is meant to make sure that the user that is onboarding is the same as in the ID and also judge the liveliness of the person. As a starter for doing video analysis you need to have a randomized video and image collected. This can be achieved by initiating a session for the user as described in Video Verification Iframe section

**JSON Request**

```
"video": {
      "url": "",
      "matchImage": "",
      "signzyVerifiableString": ""
},
```

Response data allows you to see scores and ensure a live person onboarding.

Face match score - User present in the video is same as the one in ID proof Liveliness Scores - Ensure that the a live person was present in front of the camera. Static photo risk and Pre-recorded video risk scores indicate chances of fraud.Pre-recorded video risk- This score further checks for few advanced features in the video to ensure it was captured live. Audio match score is also an indicator if the customer had captured this live

Pre-recorded video risk- This score further checks for few advanced features in the video to ensure it was captured live. Audio match score is also an indicator if the customer had captured this live
