# Hierarchy

## Why do we need a Backops hierarchy? <a href="#_ok2b8g36yraw" id="_ok2b8g36yraw"></a>

In most workplaces, there exists a hierarchy that distinguishes employees based on their position. A Back-operations workplace might also have this kind of hierarchy and GO should be able to provide this to ensure smooth and efficient organization. Banks follow a hierarchical structure of the maker checker process for audit of onboarding applications.&#x20;

> Every application has to undergo a pre-defined hierarchy for audit before acceptance.

Apart from grants, levels define the hierarchy of users.

## **Levels in Hierarchy** <a href="#_d6wr44t0tnc0" id="_d6wr44t0tnc0"></a>

Within the context of Generic Onboarding, we have defined two core levels in the hierarchy:

### **1.Backops User:** <a href="#_62xlvcbijxyn" id="_62xlvcbijxyn"></a>

A backops user goes through all the applications and documents provided and decides on accepting, rejecting, or moving the application to drafts.

Their actions include:

* View applications assigned to him
* Accept, reject, and move the application to drafts
* Add internal notes
* Check the integration status of the application
* Re push application to KRA

### **2.Backops Manager:** <a href="#_498d1riylpfb" id="_498d1riylpfb"></a>

A backops manager manages all the backops users under him and also can go through the applications to make decisions on accepting, rejecting, or moving the application to drafts.

Their actions include:

* View applications assigned to his backops users
* Accept, reject, and move the application to drafts
* Add internal notes
* Check the integration status of the application
* Re push application to KRA
* Create Investor credentials
