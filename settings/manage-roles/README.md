# Manage Roles

Users have roles that grant them the ability to take action. As shown below, different backops users have different access grants. These grants depend on the level of hierarchy they are on in the organization and allow the users to take the actions on applications in bulk. The users can create and manage roles for all the users in this ecosystem. They will also be able to introduce their own unique roles which will have their own set of grants/permissions. This feature will allow customers to introduce their own organizational hierarchy.
