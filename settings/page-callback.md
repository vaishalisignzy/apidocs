# Page Callback

The Page callback feature is used to send the data from a particular page to any callback URL. If configured, the data from that particular page is dumped to the callback URL as soon as the page is submitted.

> For example, if a merchant is onboarding for a credit card and his/her credit report needs to be pulled out, this can be done using this feature.

The details from PAN page can be sent to an API during the journey and the details can be pulled out and displayed within the journey itself.

Whenever a merchant needs to display only a specific part of any application, a callback URL is set up.&#x20;

For e.g. if the merchant has uploaded their birth certificate where PAN details were asked, then a callback URL for only PAN card can be set to allow them to upload their PAN. Once the PAN is uploaded by the user, their entire application will be updated accordingly.

As you can see below, on any of the flows, clicking the edit button will take you to the page callback URL configuration page.
