# Manage Users

In '**Manage Users**', you can _create a user_ that has administrative access to the applications.

As you can see in the video below, there are several fields that must be filled out in order to add a user.

Fill out the basic details, enter the code of the employee you wish to give access to, and then choose the flow the employee (the bank employee) will handle, then click the 'Create' button.

<summary>What is Activate User?</summary>

Activate User is used when the user has not logged since a long time. The login credentials that the user once had will be invalid and the manager has to activate the login credentials from here.

The dormancy period can be configured from the Admin portal.

</details>

The login credentials of the new user will appear on your screen (which you can share) once the user has been successfully created.
