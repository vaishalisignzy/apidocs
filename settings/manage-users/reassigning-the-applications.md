# Reassigning the applications

## **Conditions under which you can reassign the applications:**

* If a user is inactive due to any reason the applications present in his/her login to be assigned to some other active user or be taken an action in any other way.
* If the user has a manager, the manager can reassign the applications of the users who are under him/her.
* The upper(higher than the manager) level manager reassigns the applications of the lower level users if any manager is inactive.
* If a higher-level user(some manager) has no user above him, the admin portal reassigns the applications of the inactive users to active users.
* The Active/Inactive status of the users has to be updated regularly to meet the above goals.
* Pending(on which no action has been taken yet) applications to be reassigned to any user.
* Draft applications cannot be reassigned.
* Accepted/Rejected Users can be reassigned only as escalated so that in case a user is inactive and some applications which are accepted/rejected in his/her login need to be reviewed they can be reviewed by a manager or any other user but in the escalated bucket so that it can be differentiated.
* If the application is in the escalated bucket of a user and the user goes inactive the manager of the user or admin should be able to reassign the escalated applications to some other user so that action can be taken on them.
* Once the draft application is submitted again by the RM it should not be assigned to a user who is inactive.
* No new applications are assigned to any user who is inactive.
