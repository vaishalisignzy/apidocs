# Application Callback

In application callback configuration, you specify the URLs where the data will be stored in JSON format.

In this section you have callback URLs for four types:

* Application callback URL: As soon as the onboarding user completes the front-end journey and reaches the "thank you" page, it will receive the user's front-end journey details in JSON format.
* Accept callback URL: When the application is accepted from backops, the callback URL will receive the data in JSON format.
* Rejected callback URL: When the application is rejected from backops, the callback URL you entered, will receive the data in JSON format.
* Draft callback URL: When the application is sent to the drafts from backops, the callback URL you entered, will receive the data in the form of the JSON format.

{% hint style="info" %}
Check the validity of the URLs before you enter them.
{% endhint %}

<summary>What is JSON?</summary>

**J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation is a standard file format used to interchange data. In simple words, [`JSON`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) is a language of databases (in some ways).

After entering the required URLs you can click on save to complete the configuration successfully.
