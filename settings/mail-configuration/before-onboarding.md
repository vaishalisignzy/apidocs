Fill out all the parameters and you can choose whether to keep the SMTP secure or not and click on _update._

1. Email Information

You can update the email information by filling out the form and updating the information.

2\. Customize Template

Customize the email template by uploading the one that belongs to your organization. The file should be in HTML format. This template is the one that users will see when you send them an email.

### _**OTP Verification**_

You can decide whether to use Mail or not. As with **create merchant**, you can configure SMTP, update email information, and choose a custom OTP template.

The file you upload for the custom template should be in HTML format, and here, the template must be of OTP mail.
